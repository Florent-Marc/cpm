# Content's Pack Modifier

The CPM program was created to simplify the creation and modification of [Dynamx](https://dynamx.fr/) packs by consolidating everything into a Java application, which is still in development. This tool aims to streamline processes and enhance efficiency for users working with packs.


## In progress

Being still in development, the CPM program has some errors and unfinished features. However, I am open to discussions and pull requests so that, together, we can create a better tool to save us time.



## Lib

- DiscordIPC for reach presence
- json.simple for save data
